# Bellman-Ford Algorithm for Shortest Path Algorithm

This is C++ Program that applies Bellman-Ford Algorithm to solve Shortest Path Problem. The Problems here have been selected randomly and the number of the graph's vertices is limited to 10. However, users are free to hack the program to increase the limitation.

## Getting Started

* To start up, please make sure that `graf1.txt` and `graf2.txt` are in the same directory with `bellman-ford.cpp`.
* If you have a IDE, then open `bellman-ford.cpp` to your IDE. Then, you can run it through your IDE.
* If you don't have any IDE or you just want a quick start up, then you can simply run the `.exe` file.
* After your terminal is opened, you will have options what data/graph you want to solve. If you want the simple graph, then type `1`, otherwise type `2`. Then, just press `enter`.
* You will get the result of the minimum distance of the graph and also the shortest path from source to the targeted vertice.

## Notes

Off the record, this program was built for academic project.
